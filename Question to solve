1. Implement a class for a to-do list that allows users to add and remove tasks, mark tasks as complete, and view all tasks or only incomplete tasks.

2. You are given an array of temperatures on a particular day. You have to tell, after how many days the temperature is increased from every day.

    arr = [10, 4, 11, 15, 13,12, 11, 17]

    ans = [2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, -1]

3. A cab service offers three types of passes. 1D, 7D, 30D. A T days pass can be used for a continuous
duration only. Consider the days of the year being labeled sequentially from 1 to 365. Travelling is
required only on some selected days of the year(input). Given the cost of different passes and the
days on which travel is required, Calculate the minimum amount using which we can travel on all these days.
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15] output= 11

4.// Koko loves to eat bananas. There are N piles of bananas, the i-th pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in H hours.
// Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of K. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile.
//  If the pile has less than K bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.
// Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.
// Return the minimum integer K such that she can eat all the bananas within H hours.



// N piles - 1 - 1, 2 -2
// H - Hrs
// K -
// piles = [3,6,7,11], H = 8
// // 3

4.  You have an E-com site and there are product getting sold whenever a product get sold an event gets generated it looks like this:
 Sold Product Events {eventId: "abcd36239389", productId: 123, timeStamp: "20211208 00:00:00"}
 You need to find At any point in time, give me the top "N" sold products.
 For example :
 Events:
 T1 -> 123
 T2 -> 456
 T3 -> 456
 T4 -> 786
 T5 -> 123
 T6 -> 456
 Output
 topN(1) -> 456
 topN(2) -> 456, 123

//Discuss the approach.
